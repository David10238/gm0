Debugging
=========

I wise person once side that programming is 20% coding and 80% debugging. What this means is, most of your time, programming is spent fixing issues or "bugs" in your code. Because most of your time is spent debugging, you need to know how to quickly and reliably debug your code. Fortuntally there are several tips that can make it easier.

FTC Dashboard
-----------------
This tip only applies to Android Studio users. `FTC Dashboard <https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard>`_ is incompatible with OnBot Java or Blocks. FTC  Setup instructions can be found `here <https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/>`_. FTC Dashboard was graciously created by FTC team #8367 ACME Robotics. For debugging three features are helpful. It allows editing variable values without recompiling, speeding up tuning. It allows graphing of variables over time, which provides useful information, and it allows you to draw on an image of the field, which can help with testing navigation code.
